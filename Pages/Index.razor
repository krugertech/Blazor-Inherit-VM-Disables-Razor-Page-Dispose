<strong>Test Dipose</strong>
<br /><br />
1. Run in debug mode with breakpoints active on index.razor's dispose method AND the TestViewModel's dispose method.
<br />
2. Browse to the Counter page by using the left nav. This causes a page change and dispose to fire.
<br />
3. Notice that the index.razor's IDisposable.Dispose() method is entirely ignored and the breakpoint of the ViewModels dispose method is instead fired.
<br />
4. Now comment out the 3rd line of index.razor, disabling inheriting from the ViewModel and debug again.
<br />
5. Notice that now the index.razor's dispose method is fired.

@code {
    void IDisposable.Dispose()
    {
        // NOTE: as long as @inherits ... is uncommented, this event will not fire.
    }
}
